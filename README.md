# Soundboard App

## Overview
The **Soundboard App** is a simple GUI application that allows users to add and play sound files. The application is built using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface and `pygame` for audio playback.

## Features
- Add sound files (MP3 or WAV) to the soundboard.
- Create dynamic buttons for each sound file.
- Play sounds by clicking the corresponding button.
- User-friendly interface with customizable sound buttons.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or later
- The following Python libraries:
  - `tkinter` (included with Python standard library)
  - `pygame` (install via pip)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository containing the script.
2. Install `pygame` using pip if it's not already installed:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Save the script file (`SoundboardApp.py`) to your desired directory.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```
   python SoundboardApp.py
   ```
2. Use the "Add Sound" button to select a sound file (MP3 or WAV) from your system.
3. A new button corresponding to the sound file will be added to the interface.
4. Click on the newly created button to play the sound.

## File Structure
The application organizes sound buttons dynamically, arranging them in rows and columns within a frame. You can add multiple sound files, and the layout will adjust accordingly.

## Customization
You can customize the application's appearance and functionality by editing the script:
- Modify the `geometry` parameter to adjust the window size.
- Update color codes in the `bg`, `fg`, `activebackground`, and `activeforeground` attributes to change the theme.
- Adjust the button size using the `width` and `height` attributes in the `add_sound_button` and `update_buttons` methods.

## Limitations
- The application currently supports only MP3 and WAV file formats.
- There is no option to remove or reorder sound buttons once they are added.

## Dependencies
- `tkinter`: For building the graphical user interface.
- `pygame`: For audio playback.

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements for the application include:
- Adding functionality to remove or edit sound buttons.
- Supporting additional audio file formats.
- Implementing a settings panel for user preferences.
